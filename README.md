# NeurofeedbackPipeline

### The repository consists of 2 major directories:
- attentionPipeline
    - Contains the base and main framework of the [MIT pipeline](https://github.com/gretatuckute/ClosedLoop). This base pipeline contains the code that is describe in [the paper of this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513324/#:~:text=The%20neurofeedback%20code%20framework%20is,for%20scientific%20and%20translational%20use). This code utilizes a closed-loop decoded neurofeedback network to perform mental training that improves the attentional states of those involved. Further description of the specs can be found on the full paper. A simple logistic regression model was used as the decoder of the system. This baseline will be augmented with improved machine learning techniques and transformer technology to add adaptability to its features.
- depressionPipeline
    - The main study's pipeline. Should have the codes for augmented versions of the base one from MIT.
